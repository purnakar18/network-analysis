# network-analysis

Abstract: Basic network analysis done using a dataset. I have also simulated the various spreading models 

Dataset: This dataset contains the daily dynamic contact networks collected during the Infectious SocioPatterns event that took place at the Science Gallery in Dublin, Ireland, during the artscience exhibition INFECTIOUS: STAY AWAY. From: L. Isella et al., Whatâ€™s in a crowd? Analysis of face-to-face behavioral networks, Journal of Theoretical Biology 271 (2011).

Method: Networkx library has been used to the network analysis and simulation like Ego network, Community detection and simulation of the various spreading models like SI/SIR/SIRS Model.
